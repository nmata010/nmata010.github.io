# stuff i want to cover
- Here's where I started with this GitHub template
- Here are some questions and points of confusion I ran into and how I solved them
- Here are some observations after my first training run (1 epoch), with a gif of the videos that identify way too many potholes
- Here are some data points from my 2nd training run (20 epochs) where we can observe the losses falling and mAP growing
- Here are some new observations after my 2nd training run with a gif of the videos that identify way too few potholes (0.5 conf)
- Here is some confidence tuning I did and how it resulted in better results, but sometimes only marginally so
- Here is what I could do next to make this trained model better like finding more diverse training data
- Conclusion: this was fun and I learned a lot. Its a great first project and I encourage others to do it too.
